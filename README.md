# Mortgage Portfolio Performance Analyzer

A data analytics project that analyzes a mortgage loan portfolio of **255,347 loans** to identify default trends, high-risk segments, portfolio exposure, and key financial risk indicators.


## Project Objective

To analyze a real-world mortgage loan portfolio and answer the questions a bank risk manager would ask:

- Which borrowers are most likely to default?
- Where is the bank's money most concentrated?
- What factors drive defaults the most?
- How can the bank reduce portfolio risk?

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project folder
2. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open `mortgage_analysis.ipynb` and run all cells in order

> **Note:** Make sure `Loan_default.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook, or update the file path in Task 1.
